this project conduct a method for thin-layer identification of prestack seismic data
input single seismic prestack gather
first, Through BEMD, dividing the gather into different IMFs
deal with the second IMF
Using 2D-TKEO method, add the instance of gather 
Hilbert for the data
suspension of the Hilbert spectrum
find the peaks of the spectrum
obtain the thin layer top and bottom
